# 👋 Hello! I'm Viren Ghone

I'm a Master's student in **Information Systems at Pace University (New York)**, graduating in **May 2025**, with a strong foundation in **data analytics**, **Python**, and **forecasting models**. I’m transitioning into **Supply Chain Analytics**—where I apply my technical and analytical skills to optimize logistics, improve demand forecasts, and support data-driven decision-making.

## 💼 Professional Background

Before my Master’s, I worked in the IT industry where I supported global clients in infrastructure and system administration. These roles taught me how large-scale enterprise systems function—an experience that translates well to **supply chain systems, ERP platforms, and demand planning tools**.

### 🔹 Junior Engineer – VJTI (Jan 2021 – Mar 2021)
- Worked with **PLC**, **HoneyD**, and **Raspberry Pi** setups for engineering simulations and network emulation

### 🔹 Associate Technical Engineer – IBM / Kyndryl (May 2021 – Nov 2023)
- Managed **Windows Server** and **Active Directory access** for enterprise clients  
- Worked with **Cemex (Mexico)** to manage user/server region-level access  
- Handled **Whirlpool (UK)** account with Active Directory-based provisioning  
- Experience with **ticketing systems**, **access controls**, and **MEF data extraction**

This experience helps me understand enterprise architecture and workflows—making it easier to work with supply chain IT environments like **SAP**, **Oracle SCM**, or custom platforms.

## 📈 Featured Project – Demand Forecasting (Capstone)

### 🧠 Univariate Time Series Forecasting – Model Comparison

A research-driven project to evaluate the performance of four forecasting models:
- **SARIMA**, **Exponential Smoothing (ETS)**, **XGBoost**, and **LSTM**

Each model was tested across four different time series scenarios (e.g., trend-only, seasonal, irregular, and mixed). The goal was to identify which model is best suited for each situation based on:
- ✅ RMSE  
- ✅ MAE  
- ✅ R² Score  
- ✅ MAPE  

📌 _Total of 16 experiments_ (4 models × 4 scenarios) to determine the best fit for demand forecasting in real-world supply chain contexts.
